### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently a data scientist based in Cardiff, Wales. I love using R and enjoy writing about (mainly) R related topics on my site **www.hfshr.xyz**.

In 2019 I completed my PhD at Cardiff Metropolitan University where I investigated risk factors for sports injury from an interdisciplinary perspective.

My current interests are techniques for interpretable machine learning and all thing Bayesian.
